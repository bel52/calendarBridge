# calendarBridge

A local macOS-based tool to sync Microsoft Outlook calendar events with your Google Calendar using:

* **AppleScript** to export local Outlook events
* **Python** for Google Calendar API sync
* **launchd** to automatically run the sync every hour

Designed to run entirely on your Mac without server dependencies.

---

## 🗖️ What It Does

`calendarBridge` keeps your **local Outlook for Mac** calendar in sync with your **Google Calendar** by:

* Exporting all events from Outlook as `.ics` files (7 days back, 120 days forward)
* Cleaning and sanitizing `.ics` headers to allow parsing
* Comparing existing Google Calendar events to new ones
* Inserting new events
* Optionally removing events no longer in Outlook
* Logging all sync activity

It runs **hourly** via macOS’s `launchd`, so your Google Calendar stays up to date without manual effort.

## 🚀 Setup & Usage

### 1. Google API Setup

* Create a Google API project: enable **Google Calendar API**
* Generate `credentials.json` and save it in `~/calendarBridge/`
* On first run, a browser window will open to complete OAuth. This creates `token.json`.

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
cd ~/calendarBridge
python3.9 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or install manually if needed
```

### 3. Test Manually

```bash
osascript exportEvents.scpt       # Step 1: Export Outlook events
python clean_ics_files.py         # Step 2: Clean headers
python safe_sync.py               # Step 3: Sync to Google
```

### 4. Schedule with `launchd` (macOS)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cp launchd/com.calendarBridge.full_sync.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.calendarBridge.full_sync.plist
launchctl start com.calendarBridge.full_sync
```

It will run every hour on the hour, or manually trigger with:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.calendarBridge.full_sync
```

Logs are written to `~/calendarBridge/logs/launchd.out`.
